            Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. </p>
            <p class = "item2">
            He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him.</p>
            <p class = "item3">
            He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p><br>

                Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn't get a snack.</p><br>

                Often found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He's energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.</p><br>
